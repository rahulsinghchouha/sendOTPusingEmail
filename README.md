Nodemailer is a popular Node.js module used to send emails from a Node.js application. It simplifies the process of sending emails by providing a high-level API for interacting with various email services and protocols.

Key Features of Nodemailer
Supports Multiple Transport Methods:

SMTP: Nodemailer can send emails using an SMTP server (like Gmail, Outlook, or custom SMTP servers).
Sendmail: It can use the sendmail program on Unix-based systems.
Mailgun, SendGrid, and other services: Supports sending emails via API integrations with various email service providers.
HTML and Plain Text Emails:

You can send both plain text and HTML emails.
Attachments can also be included.
Templates:

Nodemailer supports email templates, allowing dynamic content to be injected into emails.
Authentication:

Supports various authentication methods to securely send emails.
Basic Usage
Here’s how to use Nodemailer to send an email:

1. Install Nodemailer
First, install Nodemailer via npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install nodemailer
2. Create a Transporter
Create a transporter object using SMTP settings or another transport method. For example, using Gmail’s SMTP server:

javascript
Copy code
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create a transporter object using SMTP transport
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail', // Use the email service provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@gmail.com', // Your email address
        pass: 'your-email-password'    // Your email password or app-specific password
    }
});
3. Define Email Options
Specify the details of the email you want to send, including the recipient, subject, text/HTML content, and attachments (if any):

javascript
Copy code
const mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com', // Sender address
    to: 'recipient@example.com',  // List of recipients
    subject: 'Hello from Nodemailer', // Subject line
    text: 'This is a plain text email', // Plain text body
    html: '<p>This is an <b>HTML</b> email</p>' // HTML body
};
4. Send the Email
Use the sendMail method of the transporter object to send the email:

javascript
Copy code
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        return console.log('Error occurred:', error);
    }
    console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
});
Example Code
Here’s a complete example of sending an email using Nodemailer:

javascript
Copy code
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create a transporter object
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
        pass: 'your-email-password'
    }
});

// Define email options
const mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Test Email',
    text: 'Hello, this is a test email!',
    html: '<p>Hello, this is a <b>test</b> email!</p>'
};

// Send the email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        return console.log('Error occurred:', error);
    }
    console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
});
Advanced Features
Attachments: You can add attachments to emails by specifying them in the attachments array within mailOptions.
HTML Templates: Use template engines like EJS or Handlebars to generate HTML content dynamically.
Secure Authentication: Use OAuth2 for secure authentication, especially for Gmail or other providers that support OAuth.
Summary
Nodemailer provides a straightforward and flexible way to send emails from a Node.js application. It supports multiple transport methods, allows sending both plain text and HTML emails, and includes features for attachments and secure authentication. This makes it a powerful tool for integrating email functionality into your applications.
